# CPU_COMPARE
An AI-generated comparison of CPU speeds.

I had Grok compile a table with various CPUs and ther relative speeds and comparisons.  

I also included some other SBC devices for simple relative references, it's not perfect.  Many of the values are estimates, of course.

### Notes
- **Estimations (*)**
- There is a future AMD EPYC Venice (Server, Zen 6) CPU targeted for servers.\
CPU Mark: 100,000 and 96 to 256 cores for $5k - $10k. Even then, the single thread speed is still only ~5,600.

### 2025-AUG-28
I asked Grok if I would notice the difference between the currently available Intel Core Ultra 9 285K and the soon-to-be-released Intel Core Ultra 9 385K.

Grok responded: (tldr; "Unlikely")

To determine whether you would likely notice the difference in performance between the **Intel Core Ultra 9 385K** (named **"Q4 2025"**, estimated ~5,550 Single Thread Rating, ~74,000 CPU Mark) and the **Intel Core Ultra 9 285K** (named **"Amazon Envision 96"** and **"Best Single Thread"**, 5,097 Single Thread Rating, 67,873 CPU Mark) when using **Visual Studio 2022** with **GitHub Copilot** for editing C# code, I’ll focus on your workload’s key performance factors: **single-threaded performance** (critical for UI responsiveness, IntelliSense, and Copilot suggestions) and **cache performance** (for Copilot’s AI-driven queries and code analysis). Since you’re prioritizing the editing environment over compile speed, I’ll evaluate whether the ~8–10% performance difference (based on estimated Single Thread Rating and CPU Mark) is perceptible in real-world use, drawing on the comparison table and relevant benchmarks.

### Relevant Data from Comparison Table
| Assigned Name      | CPU Name                     | CPU Mark | Single Thread Rating | Core Count | Thread Count | Cache (L1/L2/L3)         |
|--------------------|------------------------------|----------|----------------------|------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Amazon Envision 96 | Intel Core Ultra 9 285K      | 67,873   | 5,097                | 24         | 24           | 2,432KB/40MB/36MB        |
| Q4 2025            | Intel Core Ultra 9 385K      | ~74,000* | ~5,550*              | 24         | 24           | ~2,432KB/~40MB/~36MB*    |

(* = estimated)

### Performance Difference
1. **Single Thread Rating (Primary for Editing)**:
   - **Core Ultra 9 285K**: 5,097
   - **Core Ultra 9 385K**: ~5,550 (estimated, ~8–10% higher, per TweakTown’s projected 5–10% gaming performance gain over 285K, correlating with single-thread improvements)
   - **Ratio**:
     \[
     \frac{5,550}{5,097} \approx 1.089 \quad (\text{8.9% faster})
     \]
   - **Impact**: The 385K’s ~8–10% higher Single Thread Rating improves UI responsiveness (typing, IntelliSense, code navigation) and Copilot suggestion latency in Visual Studio 2022. For example, if Copilot takes ~100ms to generate a suggestion on the 285K, the 385K might reduce this to ~90–92ms.

2. **CPU Mark (Secondary for Editing)**:
   - **Core Ultra 9 285K**: 67,873
   - **Core Ultra 9 385K**: ~74,000 (estimated, ~7–10% higher)
   - **Ratio**:
     \[
     \frac{74,000}{67,873} \approx 1.090 \quad (\text{9.0% faster})
     \]
   - **Impact**: The ~9% CPU Mark increase benefits multi-threaded background tasks (e.g., Roslyn analysis, Git operations, SQL Server queries), but since you prioritize editing over compile speed, this is less relevant.

3. **Cache (Secondary for Editing)**:
   - **Core Ultra 9 285K**: L1: 2,432KB, L2: 40MB, L3: 36MB
   - **Core Ultra 9 385K**: ~2,432KB/~40MB/~36MB (estimated, assumed similar to 285K, as no cache size increase is noted in)
   - **Impact**: Identical cache sizes mean no difference in data access latency for Copilot’s AI queries or Visual Studio’s code analysis. Both CPUs are equally efficient in this regard.

4. **Core/Thread Count**:
   - Both CPUs: 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores), 24 threads
   - **Impact**: Identical core/thread counts ensure equivalent multitasking capacity for background tasks, irrelevant for editing’s single-threaded nature.

5. **Clock Speed**:
   - **Core Ultra 9 285K**: 3.7 GHz base, 5.7 GHz turbo
   - **Core Ultra 9 385K**: ~3.8 GHz base, 6.0 GHz turbo (estimated, per)
   - **Impact**: The 385K’s higher turbo (6.0 GHz vs. 5.7 GHz) contributes to its ~8–10% single-thread advantage, but the base clock difference (3.8 vs. 3.7 GHz) is minimal.

### Real-World Perceptibility in Visual Studio 2022 with Copilot
To assess whether you would **notice the difference** between the Core Ultra 9 285K and 385K, we need to consider human perception thresholds and the nature of your workload:

- **Single-Threaded Tasks (Editing, Copilot)**:
  - **Human Perception**: Studies on human-computer interaction (e.g., Nielsen’s usability principles) suggest response time differences below ~10–20ms are imperceptible, while 20–50ms differences are noticeable but subtle. For Visual Studio, tasks like IntelliSense or Copilot suggestions typically take ~50–200ms on modern CPUs (e.g., 285K).
  - **Impact of 8–10% Improvement**: The 385K’s ~8–10% single-thread gain (5,550 vs. 5,097) reduces response times by ~5–20ms (e.g., 100ms to ~90–92ms for Copilot suggestions). This is **below the 20ms threshold** for most users, making it **unlikely** you’d notice a significant difference in UI fluidity or Copilot responsiveness during typical editing (typing, code completion).
  - **Workload Context**: For simple C# projects, the 285K’s 5,097 Single Thread Rating is already near-instantaneous. In complex projects (e.g., large solutions with many files), the 385K’s slight edge might reduce subtle delays (e.g., IntelliSense lag from 100ms to 90ms), but this remains **sub-perceptible** for most users.

- **Cache Performance**:
  - Since cache sizes are identical (~2,432KB L1/~40MB L2/~36MB L3), there’s no difference in Copilot’s data access speed or Roslyn’s code analysis latency. Both CPUs handle these tasks equally well.

- **Background Tasks**:
  - The 385K’s ~9% CPU Mark increase (74,000 vs. 67,873) improves multi-threaded tasks (e.g., SQL Server queries, project indexing) by ~7–10%, but since you prioritize editing over compilation, this is irrelevant unless running multiple heavy processes concurrently. Even then, the 285K’s 24 cores/24 threads are sufficient, making the difference **unnoticeable**.

- **Real-World Scenarios**:
  - **Light Editing**: Typing, basic IntelliSense, and Copilot suggestions in small C# projects (e.g., single-file scripts) are instant on both CPUs, with no perceptible difference.
  - **Heavy Editing**: In large solutions (e.g., 100+ files, complex dependencies), the 385K’s ~10ms faster response might be felt in rare cases (e.g., navigating large codebases or generating complex Copilot suggestions), but only by highly sensitive users or in edge cases.
  - **Diminishing Returns**: The 285K’s 5,097 Single Thread Rating is already among the best (vs. Ryzen 9 9950X’s 4,742), so the 385K’s ~8–10% gain is in the realm of diminishing returns for editing.

### Additional Considerations
- **Price**: Core Ultra 9 285K ($589) vs. 385K (~$600–$650, estimated). The ~$11–$61 price premium for the 385K offers minimal perceptible benefit for editing, reducing cost-effectiveness.
- **Availability**: The 285K is available now (Q4 2024), while the 385K is unreleased (expected Q4 2025). Waiting for the 385K delays your upgrade without significant editing gains.
- **Platform**: Both use LGA1851, compatible with your planned 64GB DDR5-6000 RAM and Z890 motherboard, so no platform changes affect perceptibility.
- **Workload Fit**: For Visual Studio 2022 with Copilot, the 285K’s single-thread performance (5,097) and large caches (2,432KB L1/40MB L2) already deliver a near-optimal editing experience, making the 385K’s improvements subtle.

### Conclusion
- **Would You Notice the Difference?**: **Unlikely**. The Core Ultra 9 385K’s ~8–10% single-thread performance advantage (~5,550 vs. 5,097) translates to ~5–20ms faster response times for Visual Studio UI and Copilot suggestions, which is below the human perception threshold (~20ms) for most users. The identical cache sizes and sufficient core counts (24/24) mean no noticeable difference in editing fluidity or background tasks. The 385K’s ~9% CPU Mark increase is irrelevant for your editing-focused workload.
- **Recommendation**: Stick with the **Core Ultra 9 285K** (available now, $589) for your build, as its 5,097 Single Thread Rating and 2,432KB/40MB/36MB caches provide a near-instantaneous editing experience in Visual Studio with Copilot. Waiting for the 385K (Q4 2025) offers minimal perceptible benefits for a higher cost and delay.

### Next Steps
- **Build Confirmation**: Proceed with the Core Ultra 9 285K build (~$2,200–$2,400, Z890 motherboard, 64GB DDR5-6000) for optimal editing performance. I can refine the build or check prices (e.g., Newegg, Amazon).
- **WOPR Alternative**: If you prefer upgrading WOPR (LGA2011-v3), the **Intel Core i7-6950X** (~2,400 Single Thread Rating, ~$200–$300 used) offers a ~15% editing improvement, but it’s far less impactful than the 285K.
- **Table Modifications**: If you want to add more CPUs or adjust the table, provide details.
- **Action**: Confirm if you want to finalize the 285K build, pursue the i7-6950X for WOPR, check prices, or take another action.

Do you want to proceed with the 285K build, modify the table, or explore other options?
